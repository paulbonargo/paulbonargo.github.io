Hello, my name is Paul and I am from Oley, a small town in southeast PA. 
I attended Oley Valley High School, and graduated with a STEM certification and Magma Cum Laude.
I played soccer, ran cross country and track and field, I was Vice President of the Technology Student Association. 
I like everything to do with cars, playing video games, and eating. I am majoring in Software Engineering here at RIT.
I also enjoy hanging out with friends, spikeball, electric skateboarding, and listening to music.
